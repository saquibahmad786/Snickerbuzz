### Defining Depression

Many folks confuse sadness with depression. Sadness is a natural state, a necessary part of living. Depression is not a pure feeling but an effort to ward off a complex mix of unwanted ones. Anger, frustration, irritation, and grief are feelings we tend to find intolerable; we don’t want to feel them. When we’re depressed, we’re engaging in a psychic battle to blot out these unwanted feelings. Common psychic defenses against painful feelings include denial (ignoring feelings), projection (transferring feelings onto others), rationalization (downplaying feelings) or binge eating (attempting to fill the emptiness we feel inside).


### How To Treat Depression Naturally

#### 1. Find out the cause of Depression

Rather than viewing depression as a monster to flee from, look it in the eye; investigate the feelings that you are “depressing” and avoiding.
Sometimes depression is a symptom of something circumstantial in your life, rather than biochemical imbalances.

Here’s a list of the most common situations that often trigger depression:

##### A. Is there a problem in one of your relationships? 
##### B. Self-Neglect
##### C. Low self-esteem


#### 2. Fighting Depression

##### Excercise

A 30- to 40-minute cardio workout three times a week can reduce depression symptoms. Walking or running is also a great way to clear your head.

##### Sleep

Too little or too much sleep can trigger depression symptoms; shoot for 7 to 8 hours per night. Try your best to be consistent.

##### Set goals

When you're depressed, you may feel like you can't accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.

##### Eat healthy

There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It's a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.

##### Challenge Yourself

Challenge yourself by acquiring new skills; take classes or attend lectures. Use your energy in a positive way.

##### Meditation

Learn to calm your thoughts and relax your mind through chanting, meditation, yoga or other disciplines.

##### Expose yourself to sunlight, which can boost mood and increase Vitamin D levels.

Sunlight is a great souce of freshness and vitamin D. It freshens you from inside and helps to cool down your mind.

##### Talk it out

Sometimes just finding someone you trust who will help you work through your feelings can make all the difference in the world.
