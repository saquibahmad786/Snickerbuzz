In the town, there are fables of this strange woman who calls men by their name and abducts them, leaving their clothes behind. Nobody knows any facts - and those who are abducted seldom show up to tell stories - but the fear is palpable. Everybody diligently makes sure the inscription O Stree, Kal Aana (O Woman, Come Tomorrow) is written on their walls, and at night try and stay indoors.
