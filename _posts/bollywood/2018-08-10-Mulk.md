Based on a real-life story, Mulk revolves around the struggles of a Muslim joint family from a town in India, who fight to reclaim their honor after a member of their family takes to terrorism.

Murad Ali Mohammed (Rishi Kapoor), a former-lawyer lives amiably with his family in a densely-populated diverse locality of Varanasi. His daily routine included a cup of tea from a tea stall managed and owned by one of his close Hindu friends and a brief chat session with his Hindu friends. His life is thrown into a tizzy when his nephew Shahid (Prateik Babbar) decides to go astray and join hands with a terrorist organization to plan a bomb-blast. While his brother Bilaal Ali Mohammed (Manoj Pahwa) is taken into a custody for questioning, Murad Ali and his estranged Hindu daughter-in-law Aarti Mohammed (Taapsee Pannu) struggle to get their name cleared in the court of law. After the sudden death of Bilal, Aarti takes the matter into her hands to get her father-in-law and his family acquitted of all the charges that were laid upon them on the basis of mere prejudice that all Muslims are breeders of terrorists and all the terrorists are Muslims.
